# FMCv2-Prototype
Source code for a prototype Fuel Management Computer for aircrafts based on Texas Instruments Hercules-TMS570LC43xx-HDK.
The FMC gathers sensor data from capacitive fuel sensors and IMU sensor and calculates fuel volume, weight and overall Center of gravity for the aircraft based on its roll and pitch.
The FMC then tries to balance the aircrafts Center of Gravity by distributing the fuel between multiple fuel tanks in the aircraft.
